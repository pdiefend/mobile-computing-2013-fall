 * Class creates an English user-friendly API that utilizes the SGP program

 * 
 * Some pieces of the code are still in Spanish, but the necessary pieces were
 * translated to English or have obvious enough translations.
 * 
 * This code was originally meant to replicate
 * <ul>

 * but has since been modified to allow for relative pointing vector computation
 * of RSOs given their TLEs. The code for the heavens-above replication is in
