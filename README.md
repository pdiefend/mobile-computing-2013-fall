SPAAAAAACE!

This is the repo for all projects from my mobile computing class from Fall 2013 Semester at Bucknell University. Of interest is the SSAGui program which is the final project of the course, a satellite tracking app to assit amatuer satelite chasers to take long exposure photographs of satelites.
